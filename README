Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neuropsychiatric disorder with a complex etiology involving both genetic and environmental factors. Stimulant medications, such as methylphenidate and amphetamines, are widely used as a primary treatment for ADHD. However, individual responses to these medications vary, and the genetic basis of medication response remains largely unexplored. Additionally, the role of cognitive abilities in shaping medication response is not well understood.
Methods: In this study, we investigated the correlation between polygenic scores (PGS) for cognitive traits (gFactor) and ADHD with the usage and effectiveness of stimulant/non-stimulant medications in two independent cohorts, SPARK and ABCD. We also developed a novel approach based on transcriptome imputation to predict drug response using genetic profiles. The predicted response was then correlated with PGS for cognitive traits and ADHD.
Results: We observed a significant positive correlation between ADHD PGS and the usage of stimulant medications, indicating that individuals with higher genetic risk for ADHD are more likely to be prescribed these medications. Conversely, individuals with higher cognitive gFactor PGS showed a reduction in behavioral problems and ADHD symptoms when taking stimulant medications. Non-stimulant medications, such as guanfacine, exhibited a different pattern, suggesting potential benefits for individuals with higher ADHD PGS. Furthermore, our transcriptome imputation-based prediction revealed a significant positive correlation between predicted drug response and cognitive gFactor PGS, suggesting that individuals with higher genetic predisposition for better cognitive functioning may have a more favorable response to methylphenidate treatment.
Conclusion: This comprehensive study provides valuable insights into the genetic basis of medication usage and response in ADHD. Our findings highlight the potential of genetic information in guiding personalized treatment strategies and offer promising prospects for advancing personalized medicine in ADHD.
